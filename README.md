# Introduction

This project is a Bingo game implemented with several functionalities, including generating bingo cards with random numbers and simulating the game.

The menu consists of three options:

1. **Start Game**  
   - The first option starts the Bingo game. The user will be prompted to choose how many balls they want to play with (75, 90, or 100). The functionality for managing different numbers of balls is included.
   
2. **Generate Cards with Random Numbers**  
   - The second option generates Bingo cards with random numbers. The cards are created with a 5x5 grid, where each column has a set of numbers depending on the number of balls chosen. The center space on the card is free.

3. **Exit the Program**  
   - The third option terminates the program.

# Code Breakdown

### Menu Options

1. **`Start Game`**:
   - Once the user selects the start game option, the system will initiate the Bingo game.
   
2. **`Generate Bingo Cards`**:
   - The user can generate a specified number of Bingo cards. The cards will be saved as text files, where each file contains one randomly generated Bingo card. The columns will have numbers within specific ranges based on the chosen number of balls (75, 90, or 100).

3. **`Exit`**:
   - The program exits when this option is selected.

### Key Functions

- **`randomNumber(min, max)`**:  
   Generates a random number between `min` and `max` using a linear congruential generator (LCG) algorithm. This function ensures the generation of pseudo-random numbers for the Bingo cards.

- **`generateCard()`**:  
   Generates a single Bingo card. The card is created as a 5x5 grid with numbers randomly chosen for each column. The center space is marked as free. The numbers per column are based on the selected number of balls.

- **`saveCardsToFiles(quantity)`**:  
   Saves the generated Bingo cards to text files. Each card is written to a separate file with a unique name, e.g., `card_1.txt`.

- **`numberOfBalls()`**:  
   Allows the user to choose the number of balls to play with (75, 90, or 100). The number of balls will affect the number ranges for each column in the Bingo cards.

# Conclusion

This project provides a simple implementation of Bingo with multiple options for the user, including generating cards and starting the game. It was created in a pair work between Emanuel Borges and José Gomes and follows the guidelines provided by our teacher Paulo Leite.
